# Robotic-Kinematics


Trajectory planning of articulate robots via direct kinematics as well as inverse kinematics to find out the tool and manipulator jacobian of the bot. This makes for ahead of time planning and fixing out any hardware limitations based on the answers from the trajectory planning achieved via direct as well as indirect kinematics.
